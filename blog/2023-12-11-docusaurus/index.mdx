We have a new website! Most importantly, this website is the home of our documentation, and we had come to the realization that our original website had become a bit too complex to maintain due to the large number of customizations and dependencies it had. It's already difficult and time consuming to write good docs, so we didn't want the complexity of the framework to make it even harder to get the job done. We also had a wishlist of features, such as the ability to version our documentation, a blog page, and support for [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/). So we went ahead and looked around for solutions.

FIXME: insert image here.

Luckily, we found a framework that offered all of features we wanted: [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/). Adopting this framework has allowed us to drastically simplify our infrastructure but hold on to key functionality like our [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com)-based search bar and Markdown-based documentation pages (which are now a lot easier to read and edit). We hope that you like the new look and feel! If you have any comments, corrections, or other suggestions for improvement, feel welcome to create an issue [here](https://github.com/lf-lang/lf-lang.github.io/issues) or submit a pull request [here](https://github.com/lf-lang/lf-lang.github.io/pulls).
