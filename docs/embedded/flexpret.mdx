# Overview

FlexPRET is a precision-timed (PRET) machine designed for mixed-criticality 
systems. As of 2024, PRET machines are an open field of research. Refer to its
[github page](https://github.com/pretis/flexpret) for more in-depth information.
FlexPRET either needs to be emulated or run on a Field-Programmable Gate Array 
(FPGA). In this guide we will show you how to pair FlexPRET with Lingua Franca,
leaving you with precise software execution.

As a developer, you should be aware of a significant difference between FlexPRET's
notion of threads versus other platforms. FlexPRET uses fined-grained *hardware* 
threads, as opposed to the usual (software) threads. This means that if multiple 
threads are running, they can swap every clock cycle. In addition, hardware
threads are designed to be isolated, meaning the execution time of one thread
will not affect the execution time of another, as opposed to concurrent software
threads. Since the threads are implemented in hardware, FlexPRET can only have
a maximum of eight.

# Prerequisites

- cmake
- sbt to build FlexPRET

# Getting started

## Development environment setup

1. We start out by setting up a development environment. Clone the 
`lf-flexpret-template` from Github:
```
TODO: Github link with --recurse-submodules
```
2. Source the `env.bash` or `env.fish` to set up necessary environment variables. You will need to do this every time, so it could be a good idea to add this to your `~/.bashrc`.
```
source env.bash
```
```
source env.fish
```

## FlexPRET build

3. Now we will build the FlexPRET emulator. Step into the FlexPRET directory and build the default configuration with `cmake`.
```
cd flexpret
cmake -B build && cd build && make
```

4. You should now install the FlexPRET build to the FlexPRET software development kit (SDK). This provides the SDK with the necessary knowledge of FlexPRET's hardware configuration, such as the amount of data memory available.
```
make install
```

5. Next, step into the SDK and compile it. This step is strictly speaking not necessary, but it is good to know the system works as expected.
```
cd ../sdk
cmake -B build && cd build && make && ctest
```

## Lingua Franca on FlexPRET

6. Step back to the top-level directory and compile a sample LF application.
```
lfc src/Test.lf
```

7. Run the compiled program on the FlexPRET emulator.
```
fp-emu +ispm=src-gen/Test/build/Test.mem
```

8. Verify that you see the expected output
```
TODO: Add expected output
```

## Building FlexPRET with another configuration

TODO: URL
Refer to the [FlexPRET docs](./flexpret/README.md#Configuration) for more information on how to run a non-default and custom FlexPRET configuration.

# Troubleshooting

## Environment not set up

```
lfc: warning: No FP_PATH environment variable found
lfc: warning: No FP_SDK_PATH environment variable found
```

You probably forgot to `source env.bash` or `source env.fish`.

## FlexPRET not installed to SDK

This message means that the SDK did not find a FlexPRET installation.

```
Could not find
  <path to workspace>/lf-flexpret-workspace/flexpret/sdk/flexpret/fp-emu.
  Please build FlexPRET and install it here with `cmake --install` to
  continue.
```

In this case, you need to step into the FlexPRET directory, build FlexPRET (if
not built already) and install it to the SDK.

```
cd $FP_PATH
cmake -B build && cd build && make all install
```

## Instruction memory full

An error that looks like this means your program (i.e., your instructions) are 
too large to fit inside the instruction memory.

```
/opt/riscv/lib/gcc/riscv32-unknown-elf/11.1.0/../../../../riscv32-unknown-elf/bin/ld: HelloWorld.riscv section `.text' will not fit in region `ROM'
/opt/riscv/lib/gcc/riscv32-unknown-elf/11.1.0/../../../../riscv32-unknown-elf/bin/ld: region `ROM' overflowed by 70664 bytes
```

There are two possible solutions to this issue:
1. Reduce the size of your program. `printf` is notorious for taking up a lot of
space, so consider replacing it with a lower footprint version. Tip: To inspect
what takes up space in your final executible, use `nm`, like so:
`nm HelloWorld.riscv --size-sort`.
2. Increase the size of the instruction memory. This is done in FlexPRET's
configs (see TODO: LINK: ./flexpret/README.md#Configuration). This is easily
done when emulating FlexPRET, but might not be so simple on an FPGA.

## Bootloader not found

This error should only occur if you have specified `fpga` in the board target
property. It means that you do not have a bootloader installed to the FlexPRET
SDK. 

```
Could not find
  /home/magnus/ntnu/mttk/var2024/master/lf-flexpret/flexpret/sdk/flexpret/bootloader.cmake,
  which is required to build software for FlexPRET on FPGA using the
  bootloader.
```

The solution is to build the SDK; it will build the bootloder and automatically
install it.

```
cd $FP_SDK_PATH
cmake -B build && cd build && make
```
