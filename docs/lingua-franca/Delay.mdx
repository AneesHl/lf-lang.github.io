Lingua Franca includes a notion of a **deadline**, which is a constraint on the relation between logical time and physical time. Specifically, a program may specify that the invocation of a reaction must occur within some _physical_ time interval of the _logical_ time of the message. If a reaction is invoked at logical time 12 noon, for example, and the reaction has a deadline of one hour, then the reaction is required to be invoked before the physical-time clock of the execution platform reaches 1 PM. If the deadline is violated, then the specified deadline handler is invoked instead of the reaction.
